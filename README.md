# Fake Bank
I wanted to make a fake bank like the one seen in KitBoga's streams.
I was interested in learning how to make websites with C# so I chose to learn Blazor while making this.
Because I made this while learning, some of the stuff could probably be more efficient.

Styling based off https://github.com/jakejarvis/kitboga-bank
